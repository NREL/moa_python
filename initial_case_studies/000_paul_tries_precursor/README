In this case, attempting to run a first precursor based on the example from Michael Brazel

Following instructions in the notes, Paul built AMR-Wind here:

/projects/ssc/amr-wind/amr-wind and built successfully

Following MB's example should be an example precursor example that can be copied here:

/projects/ssc/amr-wind/amr-wind/test/test_files/abl_bndry_output_native/abl_bndry_output_native.inp

Indeed there is, copying that into dont_use_original_input.inp

Based on this building up precusor_000.inp (for now mostly just changing the run time to be longer)

Next need some sort of runscript so guessing at one from previous work and our notes as a first try in runscript

Setting this up at /scratch/pfleming/c2c/000_paul_tries_precusor

[pfleming@el1 000_paul_tries_precusor]$ pwd
/scratch/pfleming/c2c/000_paul_tries_precusor
[pfleming@el1 000_paul_tries_precusor]$ ls
precursor_000.inp  runscript
[pfleming@el1 000_paul_tries_precusor]$

... first test submit
sbatch runscript
