How to set up Jupyter notebooks environment on EAGLE for post processing:

1. Link directories you want to acces (e.g. /scratch/your_username) to your home directory using a symbolic link

2. Set up a virtual environement on Eagle using the Python 3 (steps 1 and 2) instructions on this page: https://www.nrel.gov/hpc/jupyterhub.html
 Note: you do not have to install keras if you are not using it - it is part of the example

3. Activate that environment and pip install moa_python

4. Install any other packages necessary for the computations you wish to do
