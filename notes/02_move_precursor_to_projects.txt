###############  Saving a precursor #####################

If a precursor looks good need to move off of scratch to protect it

(use postprocessing both confirm "ok-ness and to select a good restart time")

1. Saved precursors live here:
/projects/ssc/amr_precursors

2. Create a folder in that with a clear name for the precursor

3. Into that folder, copy from your successful
- the checkpoint the corresponds to your restart time (note folders by index note time)
- the boundary files
- the precursor input files
- Maybe add a ready to go emu restart file?

4. Open up read/write permissions to ssc at top level with
    chmod g+rwx -R folder_name
    chgrp ssc -R folder_name
