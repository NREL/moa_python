###############  Running a Precursor #####################
1. Make a new folder in scratch on Eagle
2. Copy one of the examples from precursor examples and modify the inputs and runscript
3. When running in precursor mode (not connected to emu-python through helics need this line):

helics.activated        =   false

And also should make sure to output boundary files

# Output boundary files
ABL.bndry_file = "bndry_files"
ABL.bndry_io_mode = 0
ABL.bndry_planes = ylo xlo
ABL.bndry_output_start_time = 18000.0
ABL.bndry_var_names = velocity temperature
ABL.bndry_output_format = native
ABL.stats_output_frequency = 1                   
ABL.stats_output_format = netcdf  


4. Some possible things to change in input

time.stop_time: max simulated time
time.max_step:  max number of time steps

fixed_dt: constant dt (negative dt gives simulation based on constant cfl)
cfl: make sure your cfl number is less than 1

plot_interval: how long between large 3d files for visulization
checkpoint_interval: how long between documenting restart files

Source Terms (physics):
AbLMeanBoussinesq BoussinesqBouyancy CoriolisForcing GeostrophicForcing
want geostrophic wind to be the same as inflow velocity
Can perturb the velocity and/or temperature - perturbing these helps start turbulence faster

to write precursor files, use "bndry_files" block of code
can pick a start time to start outputing precursor files bndry_output_start_time (in seconds - simulation time)

For the code to run fast, you want to pick cell numbers that are factors of 8 (ex. 64), but just needs to be factor of 2

Prints variables that are not used at the end of the run - helpful to see if you made any mistakes

To restart from a checkpoint:
1. increase max time steps
2. io.restart_file: need to point it to the checkpoint file you want to start from

Extra steps to change from precursor to main simulation (I think)
3. Add where to find the boundary files
4. Change periodic boundary conditions
5. Add physics changes (change to pressure inflow?)
